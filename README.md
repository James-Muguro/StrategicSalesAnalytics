# Strategic Sales Analytics

This project is designed to harness the power of customer and sales data to enhance marketing strategies, optimize sales performance, and drive revenue growth. By leveraging the capabilities of data analytics, machine learning, and natural language processing, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and market trends.

Our goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions. Through this process, we aspire to create a data-driven culture that values evidence-based decision making and continuous learning.

## Understanding the Data

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure. It involves examining the data types to ensure they are suitable for analysis and gaining insights into the dimensions of the data. This step is crucial as it lays the foundation for all subsequent analyses.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning forms the backbone of any data analysis process. This step involves addressing missing values and outliers in the dataset. By ensuring the dataset is clean, robust, and reliable, we lay the groundwork for accurate and insightful subsequent analyses.

## Key Metrics

This section is dedicated to the computation and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) that include Traffic Channel Performance, Segment Preference, Device Performance, Region Performance, and Product Preference.

### Traffic Channel Performance

Organic Search emerges as the most successful traffic channel, leading to the highest number of total units sold. This indicates the effectiveness of organic search in driving sales. Additionally, Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) also contribute significantly to sales, highlighting the importance of targeted advertising and optimization strategies.

### Segment Preference

The 'Extreme' segment registers the highest total units sold, suggesting it is the most favored segment among customers. This insight can be instrumental in tailoring marketing strategies to cater to this segment's preferences.

### Device Performance

Desktop and Mobile Devices record the highest total units sold, indicating they are the most preferred devices among customers. In contrast, Laptop and Television register fewer units sold, suggesting a lower preference for these devices.

### Region Performance

The Midwest region registers the highest total units sold, suggesting it is the most favored region among customers. This insight can guide regional marketing and sales strategies.

### Product Preference

Among the top 10 listed products, Maximus UM-54 records the highest total units sold, making it the most preferred product. This insight can inform inventory management and promotional strategies.

## Key Analytics

This section delves into essential analytics techniques, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and time series analysis. These techniques provide valuable insights into the characteristics of the dataset.

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics offer a comprehensive summary of both numerical and categorical columns in the dataset. They provide insights into the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of key features, thereby giving a snapshot of the dataset's overall structure and content.

### Correlation Analysis

The correlation analysis reveals interesting relationships between different variables. For instance, there is a moderate positive correlation of 0.52 between 'UnitCost' and 'UnitPrice', suggesting that these two variables tend to increase together. Additionally, the analysis shows that Desktop devices have the highest average units sold, while Television devices have the lowest, indicating varying popularity of products.

### Time Series Analysis

The time series analysis uncovers patterns in sales performance over time. The presence of peaks and troughs indicates periods of high and low sales, respectively. This analysis can help identify specific months or periods within the years that had higher sales compared to others, providing valuable insights for strategic planning and decision making.

## Advanced Analytics

This project delves into advanced analytics techniques such as customer segmentation and item-item collaborative filtering. These techniques provide valuable insights into distinct customer groups and their product preferences.

### Customer Segmentation

The project identifies three distinct clusters of customers based on their purchasing patterns. Customers in **Cluster 0** tend to purchase items with lower UnitCost and UnitPrice. In contrast, customers in **Cluster 2** tend to purchase items with higher UnitCost and UnitPrice. **Cluster 1** customers fall somewhere in between. This segmentation provides a nuanced understanding of different customer groups and their purchasing behaviors.

### Item-Item Collaborative Filtering

Item-item collaborative filtering is another technique used in this project. It calculates similarity scores between different products, providing a basis for product recommendations. These insights can help in personalizing the customer experience and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Machine Learning Models

This project implements robust machine learning models such as XGBoost for regression tasks and LSTM for time series analysis. These models are used to understand the importance of different features and assess the performance of the models through meaningful predictions.

### XGBoost for Regression

XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting model, is used for regression tasks in this project. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). Additionally, the importance of different features in the model is assessed. For instance, the 'Units' feature has been found to be highly significant in the model.

### LSTM for Time Series Analysis

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, is used for time series analysis. The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated by observing the loss over epochs. Sample predictions from the model are also examined to understand its ability to capture patterns in time series data.

## Natural Language Processing

This project implements various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from text data. These techniques include Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Sentiment Analysis. These methods help uncover hidden topics and sentiments within the text data, providing a deeper understanding of the content.

### Topic Modeling with LDA

Topic Modeling is performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The results from the LDA reveal distinct topics that are related to various product categories. These findings provide a more profound understanding of customer preferences and their interests.

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis is another crucial aspect of this project. It involves categorizing the sentiments expressed in the text into positive, negative, or neutral categories. This analysis offers valuable insights into the sentiments of customers, helping us understand their feelings towards the products or services.

## Getting Started

Before you can run the project, you'll need to install several Python packages. These packages provide the tools and functions that the project depends on.

Here's the list of required packages:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning and data mining tasks. This includes `KMeans` for clustering, `StandardScaler` for feature scaling, and `train_test_split` for splitting datasets.
